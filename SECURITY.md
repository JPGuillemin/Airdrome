Hi <Name>,

I’m reaching out because your repository is currently a fork of mine, and it’s the only remaining child fork preventing me from leaving the GitHub fork network.

GitHub does not allow a repository to detach from a fork network while child forks exist. To unblock this, I’m asking if you could do one of the following (whichever is easiest for you):

• Delete the fork
• Or mirror-push it to a new standalone repository and then delete the fork
• Or detach it from the fork network (if the option is available to you)

This will not affect your commit history if you mirror-push first, and I’m happy to help with the exact commands if needed.

Thanks for your time, and let me know how you’d like to proceed.

Best, <Your Name>
